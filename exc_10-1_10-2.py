# 10-1. Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines
# summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line with the phrase In Python
# you can. . .. Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory as your exercises from this
# chapter. Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote three times. Print the
# contents once by reading in the entire file, once by looping over the file object, and once by
# storing the lines in a list and then working with them outside the with block.

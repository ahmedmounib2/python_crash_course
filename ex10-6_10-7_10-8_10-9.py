# exc 10-6 10-7
# 10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when
# people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get
# a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print
# the result. Catch the ValueError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error
# message. Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead
# of a number.
# 10-7. Addition Calculator: Wrap your code from Exercise 10-6 in a while loop so the user
# can continue entering numbers even if they make a mistake and enter text instead of a number.
